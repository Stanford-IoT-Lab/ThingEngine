# ThingEngine

## Help the World Connect the Dots

ThingEngine is the workhorse behind ThingPedia, the open source platform for IoT rules
that you can execute anywhere you want.

**This repository is no longer used**

ThingEngine has been split in several smaller modules:

 - [thingengine-core](https://github.com/Stanford-IoT-Lab/thingengine-core) contains the core code
   shared by all implementations of ThingEngine: the engine itself, the app, device and keyword databases
 - [thingtalk](https://github.com/Stanford-IoT-Lab/ThingTalk) contains the implementation of ThingTalk
 - [thingpedia-api](https://github.com/Stanford-IoT-Lab/thingpedia-api) contains the API that ThingPedia
   interfaces can use
 - [thingpedia-discovery](https://github.com/Stanford-IoT-Lab/thingpedia-discovery) has the discovery
   components for bluetooth and AllJoyn
 - [Sabrina](https://github.com/Stanford-IoT-Lab/Sabrina) contains the AI and NLP components of Sabrina
 - [thingengine-platform-cloud](https://github.com/Stanford-IoT-Lab/thingengine-platform-cloud),
   [thingengine-platform-server](https://github.com/Stanford-IoT-Lab/thingengine-platform-server) and
   [thingengine-platform-android](https://github.com/Stanford-IoT-Lab/thingengine-platform-android)
   contain the integration layers for running ThingEngine and Sabrina on a specific platform

Documentation is still available in [thingengine-core](https://github.com/Stanford-IoT-Lab/thingengine-core).
